# Bachelor-Thesis
This is the code of my bachelor thesis on the topic: Exponential Noise: Correlation Functions and Effects on non Linear Dynamics. A pdf version of the thesis can be found in the repository. 
In the thesis we have investigated a Langevin equation with two versions of linear potentials which results a stochastic process with exponential and Laplace stationary distributions ,found analytical expressions of their correlation functions (autocorrelation function) and the simulatd the escape rate of particles under Laplace and OU colored noise and compared between them. 

The mathematical description of the processes, the escapa rate problem and the analytical solutions of the correlation functions can be found in the thesis and with comments in the code refering to the equations and sections in the thesis.

For the simulation of the Stochastic processes we also plot it and compare the histograms to the analytical solution of the Fokker-Planck equations while for the simulation of the escape we present only the code used for the simulation.
